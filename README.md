`Summary` 
The BlockChainDriver is a program that "takes a single command-line argument that is the initial non-negative dollar amount that Anna starts with. It then allows the user to interactively manipulate the blockchain and mine for additional blocks through a text-driven interface. The program creates a blockchain with the initial dollar amount and then repeatedly:

1) Prints out the contents of the blockchain.
2) Reads in a command from the user.
3) Executes that command, potentially updating the blockchain and reporting back to the user."


`Execution` 
To execute from the command line, use the following command:
> $ java BlockChainDriver x

where x is a non-negative integer representing the initial amount in the block chain.
